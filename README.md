# Water-Level-and-Temperature-Detection-using-STM32f407

This project was used for water and temperature detection using stm32f407. STM32CUBE IDE was used for programming.

**Hardware Components:**

1) STM32F407 microcontroller: This is a powerful microcontroller with various built-in peripherals, including analog-to-digital converters (ADC) and general-purpose input/output (GPIO) pins.

2) Water level sensor: A sensor is used to measure the water level in a container or system. For this project "Arduino - Water Detector / Sensor" was used.

3) Temperature sensor: A temperature sensor is used to measure the temperature in the system. For the following project "LM35" was used.

4) Display unit: A display unit, such as an LCD or an LED display, is used to show the measured values of water level and temperature.

5) Buzzer: A buzzer for detection of water level when the container was going to get full.

**Programming and Operation:**

1) Initialization: GPIO initialization.

2) Sensor Readings: Using ADC for converting analog values to digital.

3) Values Setting: Setting values according to the required range and units.

4) Display: LCD configuration for displaying the water level and tempererature of water.
